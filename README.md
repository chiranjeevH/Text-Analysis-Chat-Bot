# Text Analysis Project - Text Chat Bot

## Project Overview

The Text Analysis Project - Text Chat Bot is an advanced Python-based system that performs text analysis and simulates a text chat bot. Leveraging libraries like BeautifulSoup for web scraping and data extraction, this project enables users to interact with the chat bot, providing input texts and receiving responses based on the underlying text analysis algorithms.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: The project utilizes the `BeautifulSoup` library to scrape and extract text data from websites and online sources.

- **Text Analysis**: The chatbot performs various text analysis techniques to process the input text, such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and named entity recognition.

- **Natural Language Understanding**: The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can have interactive conversations with the chatbot, sending text inputs and receiving relevant responses.
